app.listen() has 4 properties port, host, backlog (total numbewr of opened queus) and callback(callback function)
A special method, all, is provided by Express to handle all types of http methods at a particular route using the same function.This method is generally used for defining 
middleware,
app.method(path,handler) ->method(get,post,put and delete),path is the route, handler is the callback function.
 To separate the routes from our main index.js file, we will use Express.Router.
 
 to use separate routing file from the one containing all the logic use Express.router in a separate file and then export the file from the router and require the file in the
 main file and app.use(subpath, req_var_name)
 
 dynamic routing  dynamic routing can be used using 
 
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s
 request-response cycle. These functions are used to modify req and res objects for tasks like parsing request bodies, adding response headers, etc.
 
 app.use is used to utilize the middleware and trhen pass the function needs to be excuted 
 app.use(function(req, res,next){
 ......;
 next(); //to pass the control to the subsequesnt middleware
 });
 
 middleware learn by heart
